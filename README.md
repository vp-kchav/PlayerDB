## Player service

Player service is a spring boot based microservice which serves the contents of `Player.csv` through a REST API.

APIs implemented:

- `GET /v1/players` - returns the list of all players.
- `GET /v1/players/{playerID}` - returns a single player by ID.
- `GET /v1/players/country/{countryName}` - returns the list of all players by *countryName*

Player service makes CRUD operations & finder methods with Spring Data JPAâ€™s JpaRepository.

The database connected to this service is `in-memory H2 Database`.

### Remote Debugging
In case you need to remote debug, and need to start the app from the command line:
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
```
